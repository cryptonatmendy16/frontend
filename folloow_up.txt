 your images are usully not showing, check that
the image path is correct and the image exists
put the "about" section before the services section on the home page
green text color doesnt really complement your background some of the text is hard to read
put a picture next to the about us, i think you tried but it isnt showing
also after the "about" and before the services section on the home page add statistics:
#Over 500+ 
patients treated

#Over 20 
branches

#110%
customer satisfaction

they should all be inline as style
